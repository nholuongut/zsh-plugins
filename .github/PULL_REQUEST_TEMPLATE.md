# Checklist:

<!---
Go over all the following points, and put an `x` in all the boxes that apply. 

You only need to check the box for completions/plugins/themes if you added something in those categories
-->

- [ ] I have confirmed that the link(s) in my PR are valid.
- [ ] My entries are single lines and are in the appropriate (plugins, themes or completions) section, and in alphabetical order in their section.
- [ ] I have read the **CONTRIBUTING** document.
- [ ] All new and existing tests passed.
- [ ] Any added completions have a license file in their repository.
- [ ] Any added plugins have a license file in their repository.
- [ ] Any added themes have a screen shot and a license file in their repository.
- [ ] I have stripped leading and trailing **zsh-** or **oh-my-zsh-** substrings from the link name. This makes it easier to find plugins/themes/completions by name since there aren't big clusters in the **O** and **Z** sections of the list.
